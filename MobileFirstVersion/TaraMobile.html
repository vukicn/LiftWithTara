        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="p1">With a decade-long background as a basketball player, culminating in my participation on a D2
            basketball team, I discovered my passion for strength training, deep health, and nutrition. This
            newfound passion inspired me to pursue a degree in Exercise Science and Psychology. During
            my college years, I had the privilege of interning at Mercy Sports Performance powered by
            EXOS. This opportunity allowed me to work with a diverse group of clients, including athletes,
            individuals undergoing physical therapy rehab, and everyday individuals with various fitness
            goals. I am also a NASM Certified Personal Trainer, PN L-1 Nutrition Coach, and EXOS
            Performance Specialist, which equips me with the knowledge and skills to provide top-notch
            training and guidance.</p>
        <p class="p2">
            My mission is to leverage my knowledge and experience to help others achieve their fitness
            objectives and expand their understanding of health and wellness. I am deeply passionate about
            guiding and empowering my clients, and I approach every interaction with empathy and
            dedication. At the core of my philosophy is the belief that our health is the most important aspect
            of our lives.

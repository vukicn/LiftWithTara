                <h2>About Tara</h2>
                <p>With a decade-long background as a basketball player, culminating in my participation on a D2
                    basketball team, I discovered my passion for strength training, deep health, and nutrition. This
                    newfound passion inspired me to pursue a degree in Exercise Science and Psychology. During
                    my college years, I had the privilege of interning at Mercy Sports Performance powered by
                    EXOS. This opportunity allowed me to work with a diverse group of clients, including athletes,
                    individuals undergoing physical therapy rehab, and everyday individuals with various fitness
                    goals. I am also a NASM Certified Personal Trainer, PN L-1 Nutrition Coach, and EXOS
                    Performance Specialist, which equips me with the knowledge and skills to provide top-notch
                    training and guidance.</p>
                <p>
                    My mission is to leverage my knowledge and experience to help others achieve their fitness
                    objectives and expand their understanding of health and wellness. I am deeply passionate about
                    guiding and empowering my clients, and I approach every interaction with empathy and
                    dedication. At the core of my philosophy is the belief that our health is the most important aspect
                    of our lives.
